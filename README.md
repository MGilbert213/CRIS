# Climate Resilience Information System

### This page is the main code repository for the Climate Resilience Information System (CRIS).
### The open-access code on this page is part of the CRIS Hub: cris.climate.gov

CRIS is an open, interoperable platform that streamlines public access to Federal agencies’ decision-relevant data for climate adaptation and resilience planning. CRIS is designed primarily to provide access to climate data for designers of climate services—entities in academia, business, government, and non-governmental organizations that develop and maintain their own “storefront” of decision-support services tailored for their audiences.

The main code workflow consists of 6 notebooks that should be run sequentially.
can be found in /CRIS/code/data processing.
