# Climate Resilience Information System

### This page is the main code repository for the Climate Resilience Information System (CRIS).
### The open-access code on this page is part of the CRIS Hub: cris.climate.gov

CRIS is an open, interoperable platform that streamlines public access to Federal agencies’ decision-relevant data for climate adaptation and resilience planning. CRIS is designed primarily to provide access to climate data for designers of climate services—entities in academia, business, government, and non-governmental organizations that develop and maintain their own “storefront” of decision-support services tailored for their audiences.

The main code workflow consists of 6 notebooks designed to be run sequentially and can be found in /CRIS/code/data processing/.
Two sets of notebooks are included, each perfoms the same processing and calculations. One set is written using Esri's arcpy Python package, the other set is written using open source packages, libraries, and modules.
Please refer to the directory /CRIS/docs/workflows/ for a visual overview of notebook workflow.

Several example workflows are included in /CRIS/code/example workflows/ to help you get on your way for more custom calculations.

We encourage you to write and contribute your own notebooks. Please refer to /CRIS/docs/how to submit your code to the repository.txt for a step-by-step description.
